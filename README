Homework 2 - Version Control System

General idea      ------> I created the VCS system which contains all the
                          branches I create. The main idea is that my 
                          operations use only the branch I am working on,
                          not the whole system. I choosed to work with
                          ArrayLists, because I consider it was much easier.
                          
Classes for type definitions

Commit            ------> Class created for keeping the id, the message, the 
                          snapshot of a commit.
                    
Branch            ------> Class created for memorizing the name and the lits of
                          commits.
                    
Vcs               ------> Class created for memorizing the active snapshot, the
                          staging, the current branch I am working on, the 
                          whole branch system, the first commit, the output 
                          writer and a filed 'saved' which tells me if the 
                          staging is empty,if I did a commit.
                    
All               ------> In each class there are getters and setters to access
                          the fields.
                    

Classes for the operations

StatusOperaion    ------> Prints the current branch and the components of the 
                          staging list.                                       

BranchOperation   ------> Creates a new branch list in the VCS system.

CommitOpeation    ------> Creates the a new commit on the current branch whitch
                          contains a snapshot with all the operations done in 
                          staging.

CheckoutOperation ------> Deletes the commits until we reach the desired one or
                          moves on another branch, if the staging is empty.

LogOperation      ------> Lists the commits on the current branch and their
                          message.

RollbackOperation ------> Cleans the staging and sets the previous snapshot as
                          the active one.

InvalidVcsOperation ----> Prints an error message, if the operation is invalid.
